# This is the professional section of the course

ALL the code will be developed strictly by me without any guidelines.

I will try to document to the best of my ability what I found easy/hard on each
project, and each of them will contain a README.md file with the entire
explanation of what to do in the project.

## My absolute favorite project developed in this repository:
I had the most fun developing the Day 83 project, which is a Tic-tac-toe using
the minimax algorithm w/ alpha-beta pruning for performance. Extremely
satisfying to code and see working.
