# Tic Tac Toe

Using what you have learnt about Python programming, you will build a
text-based version of the Tic Tac Toe game. The game should be playable in the
command line just like the Blackjack game we created on Day 11. It should be a
2-player game, where one person is "X" and the other plays "O".


This is a simple demonstration of how the game works:

You can choose how you want your game to look. The simplest is to create a game
board using "|" and "_" symbols. But the design is up to you.

If you have more time, you can challenge yourself to build an AI player to play
the game with you.

## Feedback

This code is implemented using the minimax algorithm for the computer, and the
goal was to essentially make an "unbeatable" opponent.

Studying about the minimax algorithm was kinda fun, and I've come across some
hardships when implementing it, but at the end of the day it kinda worked out.

I've also implemented alpha-beta pruning for better performance.
