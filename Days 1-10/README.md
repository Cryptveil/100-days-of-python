**This is the beginner section**

Some of the subjects were:

- Data Types
- Logical Operators
- Lists and randomisation
- Loops
- Functions and parameters
- Dictionaries and nesting

Those were all really easy but I decided to go through with them anyways to respect the challenge.

Here are some of the most interesting projects I've built during these 10 days:
