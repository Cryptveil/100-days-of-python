# 100-days-of-python

This repository will contain 100 Python projects, developed during the [100 Days
of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Udemy.

I'm separating all the projects in clusters of 10 days each for better visibility.

## Milestones:

###### Beginner
- [x] Challenge started!
- [x] 10 days complete!
- [x] 20 days complete!
- [x] 30 days complete!
- [x] 40 days complete!
- [x] 50 days complete!
- [x] 60 days complete!
- [x] 70 days complete!
- [ ] 80 days complete!
- [ ] 90 days complete!
- [ ] 100 days complete!

### Note:
Day 80 onwards mark the "Professional" projects in the course, and there are no
tutorials nor hints for finishing them, and therefore they will be 100% built
by me.
