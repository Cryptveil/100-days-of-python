# Another difficulty shift occurs during this section

From day 32 onwards, the difficulty listed is `Intermediate+`, and will deal
with smtp, POST requests, API calls and things of that nature.

Days 39 and 40 were copied from the final solution because most of the
requirements are not applicable today. These two days will be revisited,
and I will redo the projects accordingly when I have more available time.

Some of the projects that were build during these 10 days (There is not much
to show here, most of them were just API calls on the terminal):
