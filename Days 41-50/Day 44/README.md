# I've changed nothing from day 43 to day 44

Honestly I got bored with them cuz I already know HTML/CSS. Go look at my <a
href="https://github.com/Grellheist/FreeCodeCamp">FreeCodeCamp repo</a> to see
better webpages that I've built.

The "CSS - My Site Completed" folder contains the website developed by Angela,
and it is in this folder just for future reference.
