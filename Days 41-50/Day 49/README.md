# This code is incomplete

However, I do not intend to complete it anytime soon. The code works as
intended for the first part, but then it reaches some stops and I honestly got
pretty bored solving these bugs. 

They are all really easy bugs to fix, but they need some time to analyze and
there's a lot of them. For that reason, the code will stay incomplete at least
for now.
