        <h1>Hey this is my first html website! (not really)</h1>
        <p>
        <em>This website uses html only and is an introduction to html (although I'm already pretty familiar with it)</em>
        </p>
        <p>I'm supposed to write a bio for myself here but if someone is actually reading this, go look at my FreeCodeCamp repo, where there are actually good websites</p>
        <p>Since it is kinda pointless to follow along with the guide to html, this day of the 100 days end here.</p>
        <h2>Here is a random table cuz it asks for me to do that:</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>this is cell 1</td>
                <td>this is cell 2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>another cell</td>
                <td>damn so many cells</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

    
        <h2>I am now supposed to create a form so here it goes:</h2>
        <form action="index.html" method="post">
            <label for="">Name:</label>
            <input type="text" name="name" value="">
            <label for="">Email:</label>
            <input type="email" name="email" value="">
            <label for="">Type whatever here:</label>
            <textarea rows="10" cols="30"></textarea>
            <input type="submit" name="" value="">

        </form>
    </body>
</html>
