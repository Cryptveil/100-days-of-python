# This is the Web Development Section

Days 41 to 44 are super easy, just an introduction to HTML and to CSS, both
of which I'm pretty familiar with and for that reason I will complete all of
them in one day.

Day 45 onwards will be using Beautiful Soup, Selenium and doing more with
Python.

Since a lot of Web Scraping was done for this module, there aren't many
screenshots I can provide here.

That said, here are the projects I've developed for this module:

- Day 45: Scrape a website for data and create a txt file with the 100 best
  movies (agreed with most picks).

- Day 46: Took the Billboard Hot 100 for a given date and made that into a
  Spotify playlist.

- Day 47: Created an automated Amazon price checker that sends an email
  whenever the price of a determined product reaches a price point.

- Day 48: Cookie clicker bot.

- Day 49: Automated Job Applications on Linkedin.

- Day 50: Tinder auto Swiping bot (not working as of 2023 due to numerous
  human verifications).
