# This code could NOT be completed!

The goal for day 50 was to create a Tinder auto swiping bot, however in 2023
Tinder has a human verification for pretty much any action you take, which
makes the code impractical.

I've left the solution code from Angela in this folder, but the concept for
today was super simple and I would be able to complete it no problem.

Day 51 seems to be achievable, so I will try completing that one today.
