        <em>This website uses html only and is an introduction to html (although I'm already pretty familiar with it)</em>

        <p>I'm supposed to write a bio for myself here but if someone is actually reading this, go look at my FreeCodeCamp repo, where there are actually good websites</p>
        <p>Since it is kinda pointless to follow along with the guide to html, this day of the 100 days end here.</p>
